##SDRuby Magic Night 5/26/16

This month's Magic night challenge is to produce an implementation of Conwayâ€™s
Game of Life. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton with simple rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by needs caused by
underpopulation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if
by overcrowding.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives,
unchanged, to the next generation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.


More can be found on the [wikipedia page][wiki]. Displaying the game is left to
the group's choice, could be console based, browser based, or usea visual
framework such as gosu.

Solutions abound on the internet, please solve the problem on your own.
